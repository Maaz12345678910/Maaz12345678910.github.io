I’m a huge **Formula 1** fan and never miss a race — there's something about the speed and strategy that really gets me. When I'm not glued to the TV watching F1, you’ll find me cheering on the **Baltimore Ravens**. Football is one of my favorite pastimes, and I love the community that comes with it.

I also enjoy being outdoors, especially hiking. I’m a proud **board member** of the Hiking Club, where we organize trips and share our love for nature with others.

When I’m indoors, I like to unwind with **video games**, whether it's diving into a solo story or playing with friends. Music is a big part of my life too. I love **alt-rock**, with **Pearl Jam** being one of my all-time favorites. I also play the **guitar** — it's my way of expressing myself through sound.

I’ve always been a **comic book** fan and love getting lost in the stories and characters. On top of that, I have a soft spot for **classic cars**; there’s something timeless about their design and history. And when I want to kick back with a good book, I reach for **sci-fi** — it’s my favorite genre to read because it always makes me think about what the future could hold.

These are just a few of the things that make me, me. I like to keep a balance between my passions, whether I’m out on a hike, jamming on my guitar, or diving into the latest F1 race.
