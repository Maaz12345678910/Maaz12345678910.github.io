Hello! I'm Maaz, born and raised in **Baltimore**, with a passion for a wide range of interests. I'm fascinated by **space exploration** and the potential for discovery beyond our planet. When it comes to entertainment, I’m a big fan of **Marvel and DC movies**, always enjoying the mix of action, adventure, and complex characters.

I love playing **video games**, with favorites like **Rocket League** and **Minecraft** keeping me engaged for hours. Another one of my passions is the movie **Tron**, with its futuristic concept and immersive digital world. On the TV side, my all-time favorite show is **Avatar: The Last Airbender** -- a masterpiece of storytelling.

In addition to movies and games, I enjoy **listening to movie soundtracks**, especially from films like **Interstellar** and **Tenet**. The emotional depth and atmosphere created by these scores always resonate with me.

I’m always excited to explore new ideas, whether it’s through movies, games, or the wonders of space, and I look forward to what the future holds!
