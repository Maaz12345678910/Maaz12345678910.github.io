I was a part of the [VEX Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U7Os_xvhhA) team at **Dulaney High School**, where we worked on designing and building robots for various competitions. The focus of the program was on **problem-solving**, **collaboration**, and **innovation**, using engineering principles to create efficient, functional robots for different tasks.




### Project Overview:
- **Design Focus:** The robots were designed to perform specific tasks in competitions, with an emphasis on precision and maneuverability.  
- **Tools Used:** We utilized various design and programming tools to create robots that could autonomously and manually perform tasks.  
- **Team Collaboration:** As a team member, I collaborated closely with others to ensure the robots were built to specification, met competition requirements, and were ready for testing and competition.
