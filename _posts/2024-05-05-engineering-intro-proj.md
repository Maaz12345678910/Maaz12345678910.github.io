In the **Intro to Engineering Design** course at [CCBC](https://www.ccbcmd.edu/Programs-and-Courses-Finder/course/ENSC/101.html), I served as the **Team Lead** for a project where we designed a spaceship the size of a U.S. aircraft carrier.

The primary focus of the design was on **modularity** and **efficiency** for space assembly, using AI-driven tools to ensure the structure could be assembled in orbit.



### Project Overview:
- **Design Focus:** The spaceship was designed with modular components, allowing for easier construction in space. 
- **Tools Used:** I used **AutoCAD** to create detailed blueprints for the modular components, ensuring **precision** and **compatibility** for orbital assembly.
- **Team Leadership:** As the team lead, I coordinated with team members to ensure that all components fit together seamlessly and that the project met our design criteria for both functionality and feasibility.
