In the **Mechanics I (Statics)** course at [CCBC](https://www.ccbcmd.edu/Programs-and-Courses-Finder/course/ENSC/101.html), I led a project focused on analyzing the static equilibrium of a structure, ensuring its stability and safety by calculating the forces and moments acting on it.

The primary objective was to use engineering principles and software tools to model the forces and moments, and verify that the structure could maintain stability under different conditions.

### Project Overview:
- **Design Focus:** The project centered around analyzing the static equilibrium of a structure, calculating the forces and moments to ensure its stability and safety.
- **Tools Used:** I used engineering software to simulate and visualize the forces acting on the structure, allowing for precise calculations and analysis of the system.
- **Leadership and Communication:** As the project lead, I coordinated the analysis process, ensuring accurate calculations and clear communication of the findings. I presented the results in a comprehensive report that demonstrated problem-solving abilities and technical communication skills.
