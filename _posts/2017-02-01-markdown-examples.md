## Calculus III (August - December 2024)

For this project, I applied multivariable calculus to model the motion of a pendulum under varying forces. By considering external influences such as air resistance and changing gravitational conditions, I developed a mathematical framework to describe the pendulum’s behavior accurately.

To analyze the system, I utilized advanced calculus techniques, including solving complex integrals and differential equations. These methods allowed me to explore how different forces impact the motion, providing deeper insights into the pendulum’s trajectory and stability.

The project concluded with a presentation showcasing the real-world applications of these calculus principles. Through visual simulations and theoretical analysis, I demonstrated how mathematical modeling can be used to understand and predict physical phenomena with precision.
