In the **Calculus III** course at [CCBC](https://www.ccbcmd.edu/Programs-and-Courses-Finder/course/MATH/253.html), I led a project focused on applying multivariable calculus to model the motion of a pendulum under varying forces.

The primary goal was to use advanced calculus techniques to solve complex integrals and differential equations, and to analyze how different forces affect the pendulum's motion.

### Project Overview:
- **Modeling Focus:** The project involved modeling the motion of a pendulum under varying forces using multivariable calculus.
- **Techniques Used:** I utilized advanced calculus techniques, including integrals and differential equations, to solve complex problems related to the motion and stability of the system.
- **Leadership and Communication:** As the project lead, I coordinated the mathematical analysis, ensuring accurate calculations and clear communication of the results. I presented the findings, showcasing the real-world application of calculus principles and demonstrating the practical impact of mathematical concepts.
