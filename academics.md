I am currently pursuing my education at the **Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC)**, where I will be enrolling in courses this fall (2025) with plans to earn an **Associate degree**. My academic interests are diverse, spanning **business, medicine, technology, and aerospace**, and I aim to blend these fields into my career aspirations. I am especially passionate about utilizing **data science and technology** to drive progress in both the **public health** sector and other innovative industries.

Upon completing my associate degree, I plan to **transfer to a four-year university**, where I will continue my studies and pursue a Bachelorâ€™s degree. I am on track to **graduate in May 2029**, and my future goals include contributing to interdisciplinary fields that merge technology and space.

I am excited about the educational journey ahead and look forward to the opportunities to learn, grow, and innovate.
